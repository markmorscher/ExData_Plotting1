## How to use results from Mark Morscher

The resulting code and images are located in the /Results directory in this repository.

1. You can view the images in the plot*.png files.

2. The code can be viewed and downloaded as the associated plot*.r files.

## Code Assumptions

If you are running the scripts, the following assumptions must be adhered:

a. Locate the plot*.r file in your working directory.

b. The unzipped data file (household_power_consumption.txt) must be located in this working directory.

You can run the scripts one at a time.
